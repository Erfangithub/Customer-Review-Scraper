Man $7.90 for a bowl of soup (that isn't even that big) and a small bag of chips is pricy!,10/10/2019
"I usually get the Pick 2 options for lunch.  Today I got a Tuscan Chicken half sandwich, broccoli cheddar soup and chips.  This cost me $13 and I was still hungry after.  The food is tasty and better than other similar quick serve places but value for money is not good.  I am thankful I have a giftcard otherwise I wouldn't pay this for that!  I can get soup noodles down the street with unlimited noodles.  They used to make a good pasta but it's unfortunately not on the menu anymore.  I wish they'd lower the prices or increase portions a bit.  I feel ripped off :(",4/16/2019
"I went here in a moment of weakness for carbs, and was not disappointed. I had soup in a bowl MADE OF BREAD and I think it came with extra bread too, or maybe it was just the lid to the bowl? Anyway, it was so delicious that I did it again later that week. It's so good that I'd literally take this over pizza. Plus I got an apple in my combo - how cute!",5/17/2019
"It's a little bit on the expensive side, but the flavors are there, french onion soup was the best broth I ever had, onions melt in your mouth like butter, no joke, they don't do the toast with cheese on top but it's alright, I crave it daily almost, thai chicken salad was one of the best salads I ever had as well, that dressing wow, sandwich is not unique but nice enough, cup of soup, half sandwich, half salad $20, ouch, but the half salad I didn't eat all of it, so thats a mid day snack, would go back for soup alone, and the interior is really nice and cozy, chillable,",5/8/2019
"I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich and when I opened it up, the avocado was black. 2 thumbs down.",5/3/2019
"love the bread bowl with their cream of chicken and wild rice soup! also they have a great iced chai latte, very good value",4/2/2019
"I love this chain, Great food and great location make this place a great place to go to for a nice lunch! The only negative thing that I could say about this is that people love to stay here, even when they are not eating. I mean it just shows you how good this place is I guess.Great food, great service, great atmosphere (except for people talking on the phone while they do work). All in all a great experience!",3/8/2019
"I used to be a big fan of Panera and esp this location since 2012. I also visited the suburban franchises, but this one is the flagship I would visit several times a week, usually for evenings, mornings, or weekends (lunch-time too crowded). Loved their foods, roast chicken & roast turkey in tasty and colorful sandwiches, most of their soups, and awesome broth bowls, a truly unique food experience. The environment was not the usual ugly, dirty downtown fast food places, but a quieter place you could enjoy a meal and not feel rushed, esp upstairs. Staff interactions always positive. Would easily spend $20+ at Panera per meal -- portions are smallish, so I often buy full-size everything, plus coffee and baked good, and could rationalize that the overall Panera experience made it worth it.HOWEVER: have had numerous disappointments in the last 2 years. My several times a week visits have now reduced to once a month at best.-their chicken meat in sandwiches has been changed to ""pulled chicken"" over a year ago -- do not like the taste, or texture or look, and no longer buy any of these, sadly.-even tastier, you could get warm chunks of roast turkey for sandwiches and salads -- now I get a few limp slices of cold roast turkey -- quite disappointing for the cost. Again, no longer buy.-amazing broth bowls, with previously mentioned chicken or turkey, or egg or edamame, in a stew of vegetables, a truly unique food experience, now all gone :(-I noticed in the US Paneras (2018), they still had the tastier chicken and even the broth bowls! so not sure why the Canadian stores dropped this consistency with their US counterparts. If the main proteins are no longer appetizing, your underlying product has become a problem. (I don't eat red meat, and there's only so much mac&cheese you can have)-the baked goods counter seems much smaller than it once was. Last visit, there were no more muffins.-some of the bench seats have ugly gashes from wear and tear, many tables wobble -- they fixed some, but not all-in the last few months, they have stopped delivering food to tables, and you need to now wait to get buzzed and get it yourself -- not a big issue in itself, but it's continuing a trend of reducing value for customers-given that I have a loyalty card, and could spend $200 a month at Panera, I'm surprised their analytics never triggered questions to find out why. I do hope management reads these reviews to better understand what loyal customers care about. While I might drop by again for a turkey chill or grilled cheese sandwich, there really isn't much more to entice me. Would love to be a regular customer again!",1/22/2019
"This is a great Panera Bread location. It has two stories to it and has lovely staff taking care of it.We came here on a rainy day twice to take a break and have some soup for lunch.We love getting the Wild Rice and Chicken soup because it's so hardy and delicious!There isn't a lot of seating on the first level because of the kitchen space and ordering area, but there is a lot more on the second level and it's fairly clean too.Highly recommend if you want to get just a coffee, or maybe a pastry or even some good hardy food!",11/26/2018
"I gave Panera Bread another go. I was hungry, walking to union, and it happened to be right beside me.I was craving a steak sandwich.Why did I go to Panera Bread for a steak sandwich? Simply because it was right there.Great service and friendly staff, but a sad steak sándwich and a bland soup. Not the best chain but comfy for a Coffee and a cookie maybe.",11/10/2018
"Conveniently located, just off the Dundas station on Yonge St. My go to here is their bagels (cinnamon crunch) with light cream cheese. I'm personally fed up with how crappy the Timmies bagels are served so if you don't mind paying a little more for your food, Panera Bread won't disappoint. I've tried soups, sandwiches, and salads which were so far so good. They have nicely arranged seatings on first and second floor but the wifi used to be really bad :( hopefully that's been fixed!",10/22/2018
"What a disappointment. Ordered their Asian sesame salad and Cuban sandwich pick 2 combo. Ordered meal to go. They forgot my dressing for the salad. The food tasted bland. For the price point, I expected more. I don't recommend this location. Definitely won't be returning. Service was unfriendly.",10/16/2018
"Portions aren't great, not a lot of value for your money, food tasted like something you might get at Tim Hortons. The BBQ Chicken Flatbread came with a side of bread that was very difficult to chew through.Pastries looked delicious but were not sampled.Might come back to try them.Decor and atmosphere is nice.",9/20/2018
This Panera location was a lot bigger than most the ones we have in the United States. The staff were really nice and supportive. Also the second floor is really chill and great for study lounges. Wish there were more like this back in the US,8/30/2018
"So I have been coming here to always get the creamy tomato soup. Sorry can't say I've tried the other soups since I'm addicted to this tomato soup. You can order the cup which is good for an individual serving or a bowl which will most likely have you sleeping after you eat it all. It comes with a side order of apples, kettle chips or a small baguette. I prefer the bread which you can ask to be toasted and add butter. Love dipping it in the soup. You also get small croutons as well. A good lunch meal for about $6.00. Can't go wrong with this. The line ups at lunch move quickly and he wait for food time isn't long. My go to soup place",6/8/2018
Great place to come for a quick healthy lunch or a place to study for a few hours. Food is constantly good for semi fast food. Service is always fast and good. Cobb salad is my personal fav.,3/20/2018
"So my visit was short and sweet. They have great chairs to study and they have a wonderful system where they bring you food/drink to your table which I love! I didn't have to wait for the server to be ready with my food, I could right away, find a place to sit and wait for the food to come to me. I just had a quick catch up session with a friend and we had the best time! It has a very homey Starbucks feel and no one is rushing you! Starbucks is usually filled with a crazy amount of people and can be very loud. The ambiance was great for studying and chatting quietly with friends! This location is filled with students! So definitely a place to meet new people! My chai latte was suburb! It came in a nice ceramic cup which is nice since I was going for that feeling of being at home!",2/28/2018
"A healthier lunch spot with sandwiches and soups. They make their own bread or give the impression that they do. They offer sides of yoghurt, bread or an apple rather than fries. Only 3 complaints. 1. They give you a paper cup as their first offer even when you have it to stay. Ask for a proper coffee mug to help slow down the inevitable destruction of the environment 2. They use processed cheese on their grilled cheese sandwich 3. An American chain.  The tomato soup is always great.",2/20/2018
Order entered under wrong number. Gave a pathetic sorry and did nothing else to accommodate.,2/16/2018
"TORONTO POLICE ... Just spoke with them... Bought a 100.00 gift card from Panera Bread December 24th for  a Christmas gift. .(Don Mills location)  My sister went to redeem it weeks later and it was empty. Panera Bread maintains there was $100.00 on the gift card and it was completely redeemed within a half hr of purchase on Dec 24th...Sister spoke with Panera Breads call centre in the Philippines, Corporate Office in Toronto says there is nothing they can do stores privately owned.  Don Mills location hasn't resolved this. TORONTO POLICE WERE NOT SURPISED. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH GIFT CARDS from anywhere.  Sadly, Panera Bread has NO IDEA how this happened, which means, they r POWERLESS to prevent it from happening to u!  Will post the Police Report on Social Media. Moving forward, no more gift cards from anywhere.  Merchant's won't honour them when you have been defrauded.  Done with Panera Bread. This event and their mishandling  of it is a game changer for me.",2/1/2018
I have mixed feelings about Panera bread when it comes to their salads and sandwiches.  The food is good but portion wise I never really feel like I'm getting good value for my money. I find that their best value for the money you spend is in the pick 2 deal. When trying to save money in the past I ordered a half salad and today I ordered just a half sandwich (both times packed to go) and each time I open my meal the portion size is disappointing. The salad that I ordered last time was so small I called to double check if they made it wrong - I was stunned.Today I spent almost $10 on a half sandwich that was about the size of my (small) palm and a bag of chips that came with the sandwich. I won't be repeating this order.  If you don't care so much about paying for overpriced food then go for it - atleast it tastes good and the service is friendly.,12/7/2017
"I got the broccoli and cheddar soup which I've had before but decided to get it in a bread bowl this time. It was pretty good and you could choose between a side of chips or apple. I don't normally go here solely for their food/drinks since I mainly just use it as a place to study. Food is average I have to say, but the second floor is a great place to get some work done!",11/19/2017
Delicious food. Perfect place to come for a quick lunch as they prepare the food very effectively. High quality food with the taste to match! Enjoyed the chipotle avocado melt and chicken noodle soup came back today and had the Mac and cheese instead of the soup. Delicious!!,11/13/2017
"Their cinnamon roll is the size of my hand! For $3 and almost one thousand calories, this cinnamon roll will temporarily fill you up but give you lots of energy. I came around the evening time and their showcase was half empty. The cinnamon roll was very dry, which is expected if they bake all their goods in the morning. It was surprisingly not too sweet considering the glaze on top. Good snack but it will not fill you up. Service was quick and the store was pretty clean!Note: they don't have tap and do not accept applepay.",11/8/2017
"I have been here several times and tried several bagels including whole wheat, everything, sesame, blueberry, pumpkin, asiago, sprouted bagel. My favorite is sprouted bagel and pumpkin bagel for the season. Their garlic herb cream cheese and honey nut cream cheese is just delicious!!! very friendly staff, quick checkup process, excellent membership deals!! atmosphere is great too, less people in the morning, evening are busy and crowded, still was able to find a place. So many options under 10 dollar, this is definitely a go if you haven't tried it yet.",10/29/2017
"The only thing panera is good for is their kind of appealing aesthetics. Nothing more. I HATE their food, it tastes like a fucking MRI. Not a single time did I have a good experience at Panera in any of the locations I've been to. Their goddamn bakery items aren't even good. If you can't specialize in anything, consider communism.",10/27/2017
"Quick breakfast with Coffee Latte, Tea and Sandwich. Nothing special but OK. Sandwich was tasty and hot as expected. We will stay for some days in Toronto and use this location for daily breakfast.",9/24/2017
"We had an all around terrible experience. This is not like most Paneras. The bread was stale, the food wasn't fresh and the atmosphere was depressing. On top of all that it was somehow $16 for a sand which and salad.",5/23/2017
"It surprised me how busy this place is, I didn't enjoy anything here. I ordered the mushroom breadbowl soup, but they didn't have the bread available. I quickly got a pecan cinnamon bun and some healthy looking bottled strawberry juice....both were bad. Nothing else on the menu seemed to pack a punch to satisfy me; and I thought it was ridiculous to run out of bread -dryest bun I've ever bought with barely any cinnamon-strawberry bottled drink was just water sweetener and some flavouring",5/4/2017
"Fast and quick service, make sure to sign up for the points card if you are thinking of becoming/currently are a regular. Big fan of their French onion soup. I ordered the soup in a cup size with a baguette on the side. The soup itself was really good. What I didn't know was that there was cheese nearly at the bottom of the cup which made the soup taste 10x better. For sure I will come back to try their other soups.",5/1/2017
This place is very spacious! Wifi connection of course also features an upstairs and they bring your food to you.This location was super convenient and right downtown. I like this location because it's convenient.,4/7/2017
"One extra star for the spacious two-storey layout and relatively quiet atmosphere! The background music is soft. A really great place for conversations and reading. The drink, food, and soup selection is great too.",4/2/2017
"Food is mediocre, kind of expensive and you don't get much, it's extremely hot in there to the point I just leave and go somewhere else! There is no need for a place to be so hot that I'm sweating 2 seconds in the door! Ridiculous! On the upside staff is very nice and they have a very good chocolate chip cookie!",3/28/2017
Make sure to sign up to their loyalty program for the free intro and birthday pastry - the kitchen sink cookie is included and it's super decadent.,3/26/2017
"I've never actually been anywhere with bad service.  But I really like their drip coffee and their cinnamon scone.  I pass by it all the time whenever I go to the Eaton Center so I thought I'd try it out for the first time and I am glad I did!  After eating the scone, I said to myself, ""Is this what Heaven tastes like?""  Haha",3/19/2017
"This location is pretty consistent all the way around. I use to come by more often when I was studying nearby. It's a great place to just grab a soup and maybe a drink and just hang out upstairs in their quiet area. You got WiFi here which is timed though. I can't recall how we got around that =P But atleast you know you can work here! The food is okay. I came more for the lounging quiet space than for the food to be honest. I love the smoothies and the soups are usually good. I find the sandwhiches are sometimes really good and loaded, and other times I'm getting something a bit less stuffed and more burned. I stick to the smoothies and now the kale ceasar.. Eveyrthing here is pretty over priced but service is good.Get a membership cause every so often you get a free hot beverage or some pastry. :)",2/21/2017
Coffee is good. Desserts are good. Pastry is good. Second floor space is very spacious and welcoming. Highly recommended.,1/15/2017
The BBQ Chicken Salad is good and very healthy! The service is good. There are lots of seats in the 2nd floor.,9/11/2016
"I went there for the pastries.  I had a cinnamon bun and a large muffin.   They were pretty standard pastries, good, but not super outstanding, still went well with a cup of coffee.   I saw that their hot breakfasts seemed to be pretty popular.  People generally enjoyed decent portions of food.   Next time I'm in need of breakfast I will check it out.Oh...they have a loyalty card, that gives a free pastry when you sign up, and another free pastry when it's your birthday.  :-)",9/10/2016
"It's Panera... Chain food. Consistent though.  Sandwiches aren't anything to write home about.  Service is friendly,  great location with lots of seating. However With many other ethnic places to eat in our multi cultural city down town,  I'd prefer to go somewhere else.",8/11/2016
"My go to spot for a healthy lunch or dinner, fast service, wifi is great for working on projects. A bit slow on cleaning tables, it gets real cluttered and seats can be hard to find during rush time. Food is great, many tasty salads.",7/1/2016
"I finally tried this place after wanting to from their ads. I got a salad to go, the Green Goddess Cobb which is probably not exactly diet fare but hey...sometimes ya gotta live a little. I'm a salad junkie - I love a good salad and make them frequently for myself so sometimes, I like someone else to do the work and I was not disappointed. It was delicious!! Unlike most take out salads, it was NOT made up of soggy, wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple of tomato wedges thrown in. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful and the dressing was yummy. It was more than satisfying and filling. I only wish we had one of these near me because I would definitely be going there probably more often than I should.",6/23/2016
"Came to grab a quick lunch cause Chipotle was too packed. Decided on Panera. Unfortunately this poor choice meant paying more for a smaller, less satisfying meal. A tiny ""half"" sandwhich barely bigger than the little tiny cup of soup, which costed $5.99 and $4.19 respectively. If Chipotle is full, don't come here. Just don't.",4/28/2016
Had the absolute best cinnamon roll ever in this Panera. So fresh and delicious. Good job!,4/15/2016
"Breakfast spot before work, loved their avocado egg white spinach sandwich! But it's always different when I get it, lot of time missing out on the avocado. Love their strawberry parfait - definitely the best I've had with its price point. But the consistency is not there, some days you get a full cup, sometimes it's only filled to the half way mark.",3/8/2016
Paid $10.26 for processed grilled cheese sandwich and an apple. Rent must be very expensive here. Barista was condescending. Ugh.,3/8/2016
Often stop by to grab breakfast. Morning staff are friendly but extremely inefficient....15 minutes to make me 2 sandwich wraps and smoothie?,2/25/2016
"You can never go wrong with Panera; it has decent food, is spacious, and has a good atmosphere for studying. It's a little pricey for what it is but I don't come here all the time so it's okay. NOTE: WiFi is very slow (compared to mcd/starbucks/Timmie's).",2/20/2016
"The service was great although maybe a little distracted.The Americano I had wasn't very tasty either, and they didn't have many sugar/milk options readily available.The wifi had a pretty strict limit for a lunch place, and wasn't terribly fast to boot.That being said the food was made very quickly and the seating was plentiful and varied! The menu is huge and had some very good combo deals, with many soup/salad/sandwich options that greatly appealed to me.I will probably go back and try another food option to see if I can raise the rating a little.",1/9/2016
"Food was good and came in a timely fashion. This place is super hit. Too bad for he high speed Internet doesn't work. I got the Turkey and avocado BLT and the broccoli cheddar soup. Can't complain. Everything was as it should be. Probably will come again, even though this place isn't that cheap.",11/19/2015
Food is at best mediocre. Portion size was small. The place was neither bright or cozy with a slightly funky smell... not sure if it was clean because the tables felt sticky too. Soup was way too salty. I don't think we will return.,8/31/2015
"I've been here a couple times, it's alright for a quick lunch with friends or by yourself. When I order a pasta dish they ask what type of bread I want on the side, which makes sense to me. But when I got my meal, the bread was stale as hell, as if it had been sitting out for days. And this has happened multiple times. Considering this place is called Panera BREAD, I would assume the bread would be fresh.That being said, everything else I got has been quite good, like the tortellini alfredo, pesto sacchettini, and wild berry smoothie.Give it a try, but don't expect much from the bread itself.",8/21/2015
"I've only been here one time and I can probably say that will be my only place here as everything is overpriced and their WiFi does not work at all.  I only had a 7 dollar strawberrry smoothie and left soon after as the longer I stayed there, I felt like I was in God's waiting room or his time share cottage.  The city of Toronto doesn't need more overpriced bakery cafes, we need more yoga studios or Arby's",8/17/2015
"Joined the MyPanera membership online and came into store today to get the card. The employees were very nice about it and helped me in no time.Because I had just registered for the first time, I got to have a pastry on the house and I chose the cinnamon roll. It was gigantic!! Equaling about the size of my face, it was soft, not too sweet, and had a hint of orange zest flavor. Pretty good, but I would've preferred it to have a little more crunch perhaps on the edges. The softness made me feel like I was eating a lot of starch and I got sick of it after only eating half.I would however be interested in trying out their other pastries too.",7/29/2015
"If you're hankering for a bite, STEER CLEAR OF THIS LOCATION.  Look, I enjoy the food and beverages from Panera Bread as much as the next yelper, but this place is DISGUSTING - in all caps and bolded.  period.  [I'm very tempted to bump up my review of the Panera Bread in Markham for the stark difference in presentation and cleanliness.]Now, let's be real here, it is difficult for most downtown locations with high foot traffic to remain completely spotless..  But when you have a cluster of fruit flies humming around, and ON THE FOOD, that is an issue an establishment ought to seriously address.  TL;DR; This Panera Bread is ideal for those who like fruit flies on the side of their orders.",7/17/2015
"Delicious salads, sandwiches and soups! Fantastic, frothy chai lattes! Great atmosphere, variety of table options, and friendly service. Free wifi, though limited during busy times.Calorie contents are readily available and very reasonable for a restaurant. The Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice soup is my all time favourite menu item. They would deserve a definite 5 stars if they would have it all the time, instead of only 4 days a week and often running out on those days, leaving me frequently disappointed when I visit. :-(",7/6/2015
"Panera Bread would be my version of heaven. There's nothing I love more than a hearty soup in a bread bowl! This isn't my preferred location because of how busy it can get as it's right by the Toronto Eaton Center and Ryerson University. Even so, their customer service is better than the other locations I've been to.I always ask for a soup in a bread bowl because you just can't beat that. Some of my favourite soups include Mushroom with truffles, Broccoli cheddar, French Onion, Garden vegetable, and Turkey Chilli. Their iced teas are good as you determine the sweetness. Their selection of cookies, cakes and all things sweet are also yummy.",6/26/2015
"Hearing all about the US chain, I was pleasantly surprised to walk by this location in Toronto.   Love that they post the calorie content of their food on the menu (to add to your guilt, but it does help make better choices).  I had a grilled cheese and house salad, and it was tasty.  The atmosphere here was social, it was very busy and buzzing.   The experience here was enjoyable, and the bread was delicious.   I can see what the hype is about.",4/15/2015
"Pretty impressed to have a PB in Canada, the closest one for us is 45 min. across the border in Washington state.Ironically, I'm glad to come here because you know for a major franchise, to expect cleanliness and a cozy atmosphere, almost like a super-sized version of a Bread Garden.  Right in the busy part of Yonge.I came here a few times just for coffee/scones in the mornings on way to work, as they're close to the hotel, nothing special.  If I wanted pasta, I'd go to an Italian resto, and likewise for a sandwich, well same thing.Liked the round booth seating in the back by the counter, the VIP spot.",4/11/2015
"This place is just off Dundas Square! It hides near gift shops so go look for it! From the outside it looks classy, as you enter the welcome is good! Great selection of bread and bagels and really nice coffee! A good start to any day... Free wifi helps too, this is standard in most places though. The staff here are really nice and the place has a customer base that's good to sit and chat to - unlike some other 'popular' coffee shops! One thing they could improve on, getting the tables cleared quicker...",3/26/2015
