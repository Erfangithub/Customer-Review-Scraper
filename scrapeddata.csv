"After years of saying I would try eating something from Panera Bread, I finally did. I got a turkey BLT which was quite delicious actually. The sandwich was a good portion and just very tasty overall. I hate receiving a dry sandwich but this was anything but that.I'm definitely excited to try more items off the menu and will definitely be back.",1/5/2022
"Good sandwiches and soup. Pastries were dry/old. 1 star for service. Not rude, but not friendly at all. Almost seems like you are bothering them when you show up. When I needed a refill, (they have to refill your drink for you) I stood in front of the refill area for almost 5 minutes before someone decided to help me. Two other employees clearly saw me standing there with my cup but decided it wasn't worth their time. No smiles, almost seems that they hate to be there. I'm big on customer service so I will not return to that location. Hopefully they can make some changes.",11/22/2021
"I ordered the French onion soup but although it was delicious, it was so small.  I could have ate a second one. Food was delicious though. Would order again even though the portions are small.",10/18/2021
I'd buy here if I wanted to waste money!So yeah the food was really good and I'm looking at my empty wallet.Back to bitcoin mining...,6/27/2021
"My ambitious desire for the most popular yelp review starts by stating positive thoughts. Then, you take a bit (not that much) of humor and sprinkle it between each sentence to make it more 'engaging.' You also have to make the end of your review very strong so that the readers will be left with a very nice impression. After mastering these 3 steps, you are well on your way to achieve the most populat yelp review. Im trying, im trying. (do me a favour by going to my profile and voting my reviews!)(self-endorsement is also key)",4/6/2021
"I like this location, it's friendly and clean..Menu variety is standard for the franchise, but can certainly use a good boost to make things more interesting.This location is always busy, with alot of people who come in and just sit around on a laptop or in a meeting, so seats get taken very quick.But overall, it is one of the better Panera bread locations I have ever been to..",3/23/2021
"This Panera is in shambles. I've been forseeing its demise for some time now. Today, it's been confirmed. The service here has been slowly disintegrating - more than once I've encountered people behind the counter who didn't seem to know what they were doing, and therefore many of my orders have come out the kitchen completely wrong. The nail in their coffin was my visit today, when I discovered they have changed their Mediterranean veggie Sandwich recipe, which has always been one half of my Pick 2 order. The star of that sandwich was the cilantro hummus, which has now been changed to a plain 'hummus' that tastes suspiciously of mayo. It looked like it was piped out of a squeeze bottle, instead of the way the cilantro hummus was carefully spread previously. Also, the bread was different? Sweet, like cinnamon raisin. I just feel super gross after eating what was my last meal here. Very sad.",2/20/2020
One of the worst paneras I've been to. Please don't waste your time. We ordered the steak sandwich and it was sub par. The Mac and cheese was absolutely tasteless. We spent $48 on garbage and that just ruined my day.,12/22/2019
Not good experience 1. I ask the cashier about one of their soup and she can't answer my question after she ask me to repeat it 3x 2. There's no light roast coffee when I ask for help one person ignore me The other person just told me to ask someone else . 3. No cup cover for fountain drink 4. My soup cold as the buZzer didn't work . For the price they charge they should have a better customer service,11/3/2019
Homestly panera bread in general... is insane for tge amount they charge.Honestly food is decent but seriously...20 dollars for mac and cheese plus a chat latte and a cookie? Highway robbery,10/22/2019
Wonderful atmosphere. Free wifi. Amazing and healthy food. Nice seasonal menu. Nice customer service,9/1/2019
I like panera bread but... it's a bit high on the price. They also have good pastries and bread but expensive. A small(very small sized) soup will cost you $6 or $7! I won't be able to meet up frequently with friends at Panera Bread. It's too costly!!,3/8/2019
"Buzzer didn't sound for a long time, and then when it did, we got our lattes cold. Not warm, cold. Had to wait for them to remake.",11/25/2018
"I have to say that they have good food in terms of flavour, however the way they build their sandwiches was lacking in any structural integrity. Their sandwich pricing is slightly exaggerated, 8$ for roughly a 3x4 sandwich and it fell apart as soon as I began to eat it. As stated before, the flavours were good, all the ingredients worked well together.",9/2/2018
"I absolutely LOVE going to this location. The food is obviously good but what really makes this specific location special is their staff. After seeing me there a few times they individually came up to me and introduced themselves and even brought me free drink coupons and other treats. I feel so comfortable there that I've been skipping going to the office and opting to work at Panera Bread instead...almost every day for the past two weeks. All of them are very nice and friendly but three of them are my favourites: Alam, Idris, and Vanessa.",6/22/2018
I absolutely love this location of Panera Bread. The staff are extremely nice and accommodating. Specifically speaking one of the managers named Alam goes out of his way to make sure you're happy even if all you bought is a small fountain drink. Not to mention this place is much cleaner than their other locations.,6/19/2018
Look who's hungry? My favourite broccoli and cheddar soup in a bread bowl.   free wifi,5/9/2018
"Let me say this unequivocally - PANERA Bread is a rip-off High end loot Take this for example 6-7"" of sandwiches, on very thinly sliced bread for $10.99 Stale ingredients, leftovers ate pass-overs and they expect you to eat it. Next, 6oz of soup for $4.79 I haven't seen a bigger loot Then, my receipt says 'Treat on us if we make a mistake' How about giving me Tomato Mozzarella Flatbread instead of Tomato Basil Bread. Where is my treat? I didn't get even after asking. Then the lady who made my order, so called manager and probably the owner wanted to give me their both wrong orders just because they would otherwise throw it Give it to your hungry Mama damn it, I don't need no charity. Nett net, Never Ever Panera Ever 6"" sandwich for $10.88 and I thought Subway sucked!",2/4/2018
"TORONTO POLICE ... Just spoke with them... Bought a 100.00 gift card from Panera Bread December 24th for  a Christmas gift. .(Don Mills location)  My sister went to redeem it weeks later and it was empty. Panera Bread maintains there was $100.00 on the gift card and it was completely redeemed within a half hr of purchase on Dec 24th...Sister spoke with Panera Breads call centre in the Philippines, Corporate Office in Toronto says there is nothing they can do stores privately owned.  Don Mills location hasn't resolved this. TORONTO POLICE WERE NOT SURPISED. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH GIFT CARDS from anywhere.  Sadly, Panera Bread has NO IDEA how this happened, which means, they r POWERLESS to prevent it from happening to u!  Will post the Police Report on Social Media. Moving forward, no more gift cards from anywhere.  Merchant's won't honour them when you have been defrauded.  Done with Panera Bread. This event and their mishandling  of it is a game changer for me.",2/1/2018
